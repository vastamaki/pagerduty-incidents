# PagerDuty + ***On-call UI*** Integration Benefits

* As an on-call person you will see nice dashboard about current week incidents (by default) and have actionable buttons in example "open in dialog" if you need more information about the specific incident
* Keep track of your hour markings. After you copy summary, it will mark that incident as "billed", since many companies bill their customer based on incidents, this is a very convenient way to keep track of hour markings
* Continuously new features, this application is developed by people, who use Pagerduty as on-call purposes. If you think that something could be better, please contribute in [Github](https://github.com/vastamaki/pagerduty-incidents) or email us at pagerduty@customui.app and we might implement that feature!
* As already mentioned, 100% opensource without backend, so you can contribute to this project! :)
 
# How it Works
This application uses Pagerduty REST API to show teams and incidents from Pagerduty. It will use that data to visualize each incident as "card" and provides some actions for the user (in example summary copying for purpose of faster hour marking)

# Requirements
At the moment the only requirement is that your Pagerduty organization has at least one team, otherwise our UI can't know where to search incidents.

# Support

If you need help while using this application or you have feature requests, please contact ***pagerduty@customui.app*** We continuously add new features and integrations to this application! 

## In ***Pagerduty On-call UI***

This application does not require any kind of configuring, this application is only an alternative UI for pagerduty.

# How to Uninstall

Navigate to **My Profile** in the Pagerduty, open **User Settings**. In **Applications** you should see "Pagerduty On-call UI", click **Revoke** to stop using the application.
