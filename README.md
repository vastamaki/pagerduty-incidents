## Development

### Backend
This application does not have backend currently.

You need nodejs 12 and npm. Just install node modules using command `npm install` and after that you are ready to run `npm start` to start development server. You need Pagerduty token, if you dont have one, see [instructions](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#generating-a-personal-rest-api-key)
